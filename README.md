# Empowher

This is an app that promotes female empowerment.

To demo this app follow the following steps:

 - Installation Steps
    - Install the Expo app from the App Store or the Google Play Store
    - You can set your phone aside for now
    - Install Node.js on your computer
    - (Optional) Install yarn using npm
    - Use npm or yarn to install expo-cli globally
 - Running our apps from your computer
    - Clone the repo to your local computer
    - cd into the BlackRockChallenge folder
    - Run <code>expo start</code>
    - A page (localhost:19002) will open up in the browser.
    - Using the phone that you downloaded the expo app on, scan the QR code on the page with a QR scanning app or the camera
    - It will then launch the app on your phone
 - Running our app without any installation on your computer
    - Make sure the expo app is installed on your phone
    - Visit [this website](https://expo.io/@ramyac/projects/empowher) in your browser and scan the QR code
    - It will then launch the app on your phone
    - NOTE: This is dependent on how recently I published the app to Expo, it's likely this link may not be up to date so I reccomend using the computer installation method
